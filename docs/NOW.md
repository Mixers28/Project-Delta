# NOW - Working Memory (WM)

> This file captures the **current focus / sprint**.<br>
> It should always describe what we're doing *right now*.

<!-- SUMMARY_START -->
**Current Focus (auto-maintained by Agent):**
- Finalize the 7-step tutorial pattern progression and verify per-level gating (suited/color runs should work when explicitly allowed).
- Remove Suit/Color Set patterns from gameplay and ensure goals/achievements/docs align.
- UI polish: startup intro copy and win/lose button readability (Continue label size).
- Keep README + memory docs aligned with recent gameplay/rules changes.
<!-- SUMMARY_END -->

## Current Objective

Ship a stable, iteratable Project Delta loop: tutorial → early real game ramp → run mode and unlocks, with reliable level solvability.

---

## Active Branch

- `main`

---

## What We Are Working On Right Now

- [ ] Tutorial: confirm step 1–7 goals/patterns match the new rule order and play correctly.
- [ ] Pattern gating: ensure explicit `allowedPatterns` overrides exclusions in tutorial and sessions.
- [ ] UI: verify Continue button label matches action button readability.
- [ ] Docs: update README + memory docs to reflect tutorial/pattern changes.

---

## Next Small Deliverables

- Backend service verified live on Railway with working signup/login.
- WebGL signup/login works on mobile (keyboard prompt appears).
- Safe-area alignment and menu visibility validated across devices.

## Notes / Scratchpad

- No blockers tracked here; keep this section for concrete issues (e.g., test failures, Unity version mismatches, or content/pacing questions).
